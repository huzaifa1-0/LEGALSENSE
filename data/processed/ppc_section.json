    "378.": "Theft:  \nWhoever, intending to take di shonestly any movable property out of the possession of any \nperson without that person's consent, moves that property in order to su ch taking, is said to \ncommit theft.  Explanation 1: A thing so long as it is attach ed to the earth, not being movable property, is \nnot the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of  being the subject of theft as soon as it is \nserved from the earth.  Explanation 2: A moving effected by the same  act which effects the severance may be a \ntheft.  \nExplanation 3: A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle, which \nprevented it from moving, or by separating it fr om any other thing, as well as by actually \nmoving it.  \nExplanation 4: A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that \nanimal, and to move everything which, in cons equence of the motion so caused, is moved \nby that animal.  \nExplanation 5: The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may \nbe given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose \nauthority either express or implied.  \n \nIllustrations \n(a)  A cuts down a tree on Z's ground with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out \nof Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order \nto such taking, the has committed theft.  \n  (b)  A puts a bait for dogs in his pockets, and t hus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here if A's \nintention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's posse ssion without Z's consent A has \ncommitted theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.  \n  (c)  A meets a bullock carrying a box of treas ure. He drives the bullock in a certain \ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock \nbegins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.  \n  (d)  A being Z's servant and en trusted by Z with the care of  Z's plate, dishonestly runs \naway with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.  \n  (e)  Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall \nreturn. A carries the plate to a goldsmith a nd sells it. Here the plate was not in 2's \npossession. It could not, therefore, be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not \ncommitted theft though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.    \n(f)  A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring \nin Z's possession, and if A dishonestly  removes it. A commits theft.  \n  (g)  A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not  in the possession of a ny person. A. by taking \nit, commits no theft, though he may comm it criminal misappropriation of property,  \n  (h)  A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on  a table in Z's house. Not venturing to \nmisappropriate the ring immediat ely for fear of search a nd detection A hides the ring \nin a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z. with the intention of taking the ring from the hidi ng place and soiling it when the toss is \nforgotten Here A. at the time of fi rst moving the ring, commits the theft.  \n  (i)  A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller to  be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not \nowing to the jeweller, any debt for which the jewellers might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Y's hand, and \ncarries it away. Here A, though he may have  committed criminal trespass and assault, \nhas not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.  \n  (j)  If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a \nsecurity for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of \ndepriving Z of the property as security for hi s debt. he commits theft, inasmuch as he \ntakes it dishonestly.  \n  (k)  Again, if A. having pawned his. watch to Z, takes it of Z's possession without Z's \nconsent not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the \nwatch is his own property inasmuch  as he takes it dishonestly.  \n  (l)  A takes an article belong ing to Z out of Z's possession w ithout Z's consent, with the \nintention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration Here A takes dishonestly: A has. therefore, committed theft.  \n  (m) A being on friendly terms w ith Z, goes to Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a \nbook without Z's express consent for the purpos e merely of reading it. and with the \nintention of returning it. Here , it is probable that A may have  conceived that he had Z's \nimplied consent to use Z's book. If this wa s A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n  (n)  A asks charity from Z's wife. She give s A money, food and clothes, which A knows to \nbelong to her husband. Here it is probable th at A may conceive that Z's wife is \nauthorised to give away alms. If this wa s A's impression. A has not committed theft.  \n  (o)  A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such pr operty as she has no authority from Z to \ngive. If A takes the property di shonestly, he commits theft.  \n  (p)  A, in good faith believing property belongi ng to Z to be A's own property, takes that \nproperty out of S's possession.
